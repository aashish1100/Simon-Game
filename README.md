# Simon Game

## 📝 Overview

The **Simon Game** is a classic memory game where players are challenged to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. As the levels progress, the sequences become longer and more difficult, testing the player's memory and attention.

## 🎮 Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players must recall and replicate sequences of colors presented by the game.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each new level adds another color to the sequence, making it progressively harder.
- **Visual Feedback**: Lights indicate correct and incorrect sequences to guide the player.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: For handling game logic, sequence generation, and user interaction.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click on the start button to begin the game.
2. **Observe the Sequence**: Watch as the game highlights a sequence of colors. Pay close attention!
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence shown by the game.
4. **Advance to the Next Level**: If you correctly reproduce the sequence, you'll advance to the next level, where an additional color will be added to the sequence.
5. **Game Over**: If you click the wrong sequence, the game will reset, and you can try again!
